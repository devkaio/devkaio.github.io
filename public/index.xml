      <description>&lt;p&gt;Hey! Thanks for coming by. I am a Flutter Developer learning how to code better every day.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;But that wasn&amp;rsquo;t always the case. I started my career in 2010 as an IT intern at JUCEA-AM. Then I worked for some time as a web designer focused on CMS like WordPress.&lt;/p&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;In early 2018 I entered for educational sector as Academic Advisor at the same time I came across Flutter. It was love at first sight. Multiplatform development with a single code base, how awesome is that? But I didn&amp;rsquo;t get the time to dedicate to my studies. So in mid-2020 I wrapped my head around it and started my study path for real. Only in 2021 I got my first job opportunity and started working as a Flutter Developer at Raro Labs (MG).&lt;/p&gt;</description>
