    <h1>About</h1>
    
    
    <div>
        <p>Hey! Thanks for coming by. I am a Flutter Developer learning how to code better every day.</p>
<p>But that wasn&rsquo;t always the case. I started my career in 2010 as an IT intern at JUCEA-AM. Then I worked for some time as a web designer focused on CMS like WordPress.</p>
<p>In early 2018 I entered for educational sector as Academic Advisor at the same time I came across Flutter. It was love at first sight. Multiplatform development with a single code base, how awesome is that? But I didn&rsquo;t get the time to dedicate to my studies. So in mid-2020 I wrapped my head around it and started my study path for real. Only in 2021 I got my first job opportunity and started working as a Flutter Developer at Raro Labs (MG).</p>
<p>Since then, I became quite fascinated with Dart and Flutter, trying to go deeper and deeper into the hows, whys, and whatnot. The experience I had with education before made me look for opportunities that could make me keep learning Flutter and share this knowledge. That&rsquo;s when in mid-2022 I started as a mentor for Raro Academy Flutter Developer Program and then Proz Tecnologia Mobile Program.</p>
<p>In Early 2023 I started a new journey in my international career as a Flutter Developer at ecoPortal&rsquo;s mobile team.</p>
<p>I intend to become a Dart and Flutter specialist so I can keep sharing my knowledge with people who get fascinated with Flutter as I did.</p>
